                Speaking of saving, you only pay for the ﬁxing service when the pad has been ﬁxed and conﬁrmed working fully. <br> Whether X is not working, player keeps going in one direction(Analog drift) or Ronaldo no de run again 😄, we de ﬁx am.
                <br><br>
                You only pay little money for pickup of the pad from your location(or recieve pad sent from you through a driver or...) and start work <br> 1k — 1pad <br> +900 — 2pads <br> +900 — 3pads <br> Just like that. <br><br>
                After ﬁxing and conﬁrmed working fully. <br> (99% of spoilt pads can be ﬁxed) <br> Only then, can you complete payment. <br><br>
                To complete payment of the service: <br> 2k — 3.5k per pad <br><br>
                Then we deliver it back to you or send to your location at our own expense. <br><br>
                As sweet as it sounds 🙂.
